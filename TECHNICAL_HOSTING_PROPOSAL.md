## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines three hosting options for the Tonic Music Program Registration System. We recommend Google Cloud Platform as the best choice for reliability and integration, with Firebase and Render as cost-effective alternatives.

**Hosting Options:**
- **Best Choice:** Google Cloud Platform - $50-70/month
- **Budget Alternative 1:** Firebase - $10-35/month (serverless)
- **Budget Alternative 2:** Render.com - $25-75/month (always-on)

## Current System Overview

The Tonic application is a simple, efficient system that:
- Manages student registration for music programs

- Uses minimal server resources

**Key Requirements:**
- Reliable access during registration periods
- Secure handling of student information
- Easy administration through Google accounts
- Cost-effective for school budget

## Option 1: Google Cloud Platform (RECOMMENDED)

### Why Google Cloud Platform is the Best Choice

**Always Available**
- Your application stays running 24/7 without interruptions
- Instant response times for all users
- No delays during busy registration periods
- Guaranteed uptime for school operations

**Perfect Google Integration**
- Seamless connection to your existing Google Sheets

- No additional authentication setup needed
- Takes full advantage of Google's education tools

**Optimized Performance**
- Specially designed to work with Google Sheets API

- Automatic scaling during high-usage periods

### Cost Breakdown

| What You Get | Monthly Cost |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Always-on hosting** | $30-40 |
| **Security & SSL certificates** | $10-15 |
| **Global content delivery** | $5-10 |
| **Monitoring & support** | $5-10 |
| **Educational discount (20%)** | -$10-15 |
| | |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | **$50-70** |
| **Annual Cost** | **$600-840** |

### What This Means for Your School

- **Reliable:** Parents and staff can always access the system

- **Secure:** Enterprise-grade security for student data
- **Professional:** Custom domain (music.yourschool.edu)
- **Scalable:** Handles growth as your program expands

## Option 2: Firebase (BUDGET ALTERNATIVE)

### What is Firebase?

Firebase uses "serverless" technology, which means your application "sleeps" when no one is using it and "wakes up" when someone visits. This saves money but comes with a small trade-off.

**How Serverless Works:**
- When busy: Application responds instantly (stays "awake")
- When idle: Application goes to sleep after 15 minutes
- First visitor after sleep: 1-2 second delay to wake up
- Subsequent visitors: Instant response

**Google Integration Benefits:**
- Full Google Workspace integration
- Same Google Sheets connectivity as GCP
- Google account authentication
- All the Google ecosystem advantages

### Cost Breakdown

| What You Get | Monthly Cost |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Serverless hosting** | $10-20 |
| **Google Sheets integration** | $5-10 |
| **Security & SSL** | $0-5 |
| **Global content delivery** | $0-5 |
| | |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | **$10-35** |
| **Annual Cost** | **$120-420** |

### Best For Schools That:
- Want significant cost savings (50-70% less than GCP)
- Can accept occasional 1-2 second delays
- Have moderate usage patterns
- Value Google ecosystem integration

---

## Option 3: Render.com (CURRENT HOSTING)

### What is Render?

Render is a straightforward hosting platform that keeps your application running continuously. It's simple to manage but doesn't have the same Google integration benefits.

**Always-On Hosting:**
- Application runs 24/7 without sleeping
- Instant response times for all users
- No wake-up delays
- Reliable performance during busy periods

**Integration Limitations:**
- Google Sheets connection works but isn't optimized
- Limited Google Workspace integration
- Standard web authentication (not Google-native)
- Manual setup for any Google services

### Cost Breakdown

| Service Level | Features | Monthly Cost |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Starter** | Basic always-on hosting | $25 |
| **Standard** | Enhanced performance | $50 |
| **Professional** | Premium features | $75 |

### Best For Schools That:
- Want simple, always-on hosting
- Have budget constraints
- Don't need advanced Google integration
- Prefer straightforward management
