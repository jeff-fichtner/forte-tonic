# Migration DEV002 Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the `Migration_DEV002_FillAndResetRegistrations.js` to align with the actual application patterns for registration creation, incorporating insights from the domain-driven design architecture and real usage patterns.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Registration Type Distribution
**Before:** All registrations were created as 'group' type only
**After:** Mixed registration types following app patterns:
- 60% group registrations 
- 40% private registrations

This reflects the actual RegistrationType enum used in the application (`'private'` and `'group'`).

### 2. Registration Object Structure
**Updated to match the 16-column database schema:**
```javascript
[
  registrationId,        // Id (UUID)
  studentId,            // StudentId 
  instructorId,         // InstructorId
  day,                  // Day (Monday-Friday)
  startTime,            // StartTime (HH:MM format)
  length,               // Length (30/45/60 minutes)
  registrationType,     // RegistrationType ('private' or 'group')
  roomId,               // RoomId 
  instrument,           // Instrument
  transportationType,   // TransportationType
  notes,                // Notes
  classId,              // ClassId (only for group registrations)
  classTitle,           // ClassTitle (only for group registrations)
  expectedStartDate,    // ExpectedStartDate
  createdAt,            // CreatedAt
  createdBy             // CreatedBy
]
```

### 3. Realistic Schedule Generation
**Enhanced scheduling logic:**
- Business hours: 9 AM - 5 PM
- Time slots: :00 and :30 minutes only
- Random day selection from Monday-Friday
- Length varies by registration type:
  - Private lessons: 30, 45, or 60 minutes
  - Group lessons: 45 or 60 minutes

### 4. Instructor Assignment Logic
**Improved instructor assignment:**
- Group registrations: Use the class instructor
- Private registrations: Random assignment from available instructors
- Fallback to default instructor if none specified

### 5. Room Assignment Patterns
**Room assignment following app patterns:**
- Group lessons: GROUP-ROOM-1, GROUP-ROOM-2, GROUP-ROOM-3
- Private lessons: ROOM-1 through ROOM-8

### 6. Transportation Options
**Added realistic transportation types:**
- parent_drop_off
- independent
- walk
- school_bus

### 7. Audit Record Creation
**Updated audit structure to match app patterns:**
```javascript
{
  id: UUID,                    // Unique audit ID
  registration_id: UUID,       // Foreign key to registration
  action: 'INSERT',           // Action type
  timestamp: ISO_timestamp,    // When the action occurred
  user: 'MIGRATION_DEV002',   // Who performed the action
  old_values: '{}',           // Empty for INSERT actions
  new_values: JSON_object     // Complete registration data
}
```

### 8. Data Format Handling
**Updated `writeSheetData` method:**
- Now handles both array data (new format) and object data (legacy)
- Automatically sets appropriate headers for registrations vs audit sheets
- Better error handling and logging

### 9. Enhanced Logging and Analytics
**Added comprehensive logging:**
- Registration type breakdown (private vs group percentages)
- Final summary with statistics
- Error tracking for problematic records
- Progress indicators during execution

## Class and Student Association Logic

### Group Registrations
- Use the class instructor and room
- Include ClassId and ClassTitle
- Follow class-specific patterns for scheduling

### Private Registrations  
- Independent instructor assignment
- Private room allocation
- No class association (ClassId and ClassTitle are null)
- More flexible scheduling

## Business Logic Alignment

The migration now follows the actual app's business rules:

1. **Domain Model Compliance:** Uses the same RegistrationType values as the Registration domain entity
2. **Service Layer Patterns:** Mimics the RegistrationApplicationService workflow for creating registrations
3. **Audit Trail:** Follows the same audit logging patterns used by the app's audit service
4. **Data Validation:** Includes the same type of validation and error handling found in the app

## Testing and Validation

The updated migration includes:
- Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting
- Progress indicators for monitoring execution
- Statistical breakdown of created data
- Validation of required fields before processing

## Usage

Run the migration as before:
```javascript
// Preview first
previewFillAndResetRegistrationsMigration()

// Execute with options
runFillAndResetRegistrationsMigration({
  fillPercent: 0.75,        // Fill classes to 75% capacity
  createAudit: true,        // Create audit records
  wipeAudit: true          // Clear existing audit data
})
```

## Result

The migration now creates realistic test data that:
- Matches the actual database schema used in production
- Follows the same business rules as the application
- Creates appropriate audit trails
- Provides a mix of private and group registrations
- Uses realistic scheduling and assignment patterns

This ensures that development and testing environments have data that accurately reflects how the application actually works in practice.
