# Cache Invalidation Bug Fix - Registration Repository

## Issue Description

After deleting registrations, the application was returning empty registration lists instead of refreshing from Google Sheets. This was caused by incomplete cache invalidation in the delete method.

## Root Cause

The `delete` method in `registrationRepository.js` was using:

```javascript
this.dbClient.cache.delete('registrations');
```

This only cleared the cached data but **not** the cache timestamps. The `getCachedData` method checks both:

1. `this.cache.get(sheetKey)` - The actual cached data (was being cleared ‚úÖ)
2. `this.cacheTimestamps.get(sheetKey)` - The cache timestamp (was NOT being cleared ‚ùå)

Since the timestamp remained, `getCachedData` thought it had valid cache and returned `undefined` instead of loading fresh data.

## The Fix

Changed from incomplete cache clearing:
```javascript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Only clears cache data, leaves timestamps
this.dbClient.cache.delete('registrations');
```

To proper cache clearing:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ AFTER: Clears both cache data AND timestamps
this.dbClient.clearCache('registrations');
```

## Technical Details

### getCachedData Logic (Google Sheets DB Client)
```javascript
async getCachedData(sheetKey, mapFunc = null) {
  const now = Date.now();
  const cachedTime = this.cacheTimestamps.get(sheetKey); // üîç This was the problem

  if (cachedTime && now - cachedTime < this.CACHE_TTL) {
    // Cache hit - returns cached data (or undefined if cache was cleared)
    return this.cache.get(sheetKey);
  }

  // Cache miss - loads fresh data
  const data = await this.getAllRecords(sheetKey, mapFunc);
  this.cache.set(sheetKey, data);
  this.cacheTimestamps.set(sheetKey, now);
  return data;
}
```

### Proper clearCache Method
```javascript
clearCache(sheetKey = null) {
  if (sheetKey) {
    this.cache.delete(sheetKey);           // Clear data
    this.cacheTimestamps.delete(sheetKey); // Clear timestamp ‚≠ê KEY FIX
  } else {
    this.cache.clear();
    this.cacheTimestamps.clear();
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/repositories/registrationRepository.js`**
   - Line 262: Changed `this.dbClient.cache.delete('registrations')` to `this.dbClient.clearCache('registrations')`

2. **`tests/unit/registrationRepository.test.js`**
   - Added `clearCache: jest.fn()` to mock database client
   - Updated test expectation to verify proper cache clearing

## Impact

- ‚úÖ Registrations now properly refresh after deletion
- ‚úÖ Users see updated data immediately 
- ‚úÖ Cache invalidation works correctly across all repository operations
- ‚úÖ All existing tests continue to pass

## Testing

The fix was verified with:
1. Unit tests (119 tests passing)
2. Cache behavior demonstration script (`dev/scripts/test_cache_fix.js`)
3. Manual verification that the cache clearing logic works correctly

## Prevention

This type of bug can be prevented by:
1. Always using the proper `clearCache()` method instead of direct cache manipulation
2. Understanding that caching systems often have multiple components (data + metadata)
3. Testing cache invalidation scenarios in unit tests
