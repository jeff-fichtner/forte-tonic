# Bug Fix Summary: ViewModel ID Comparison Issue

## Issue
Error: `viewModel.js:236 Instructor or student not found for registration: 131509_TEACHER1@EMAIL.COM_Monday_17:15`

## Root Cause
The `Registration` model uses value objects (`StudentId` and `InstructorId`) for ID properties, but the comparison logic in `viewModel.js` was trying to compare these value objects directly with primitive string/number IDs from students and instructors arrays.

```javascript
// ❌ BROKEN: Comparing value object with primitive
const instructor = this.instructors.find(x => x.id === registration.instructorId);
const student = this.students.find(x => x.id === registration.studentId);

// ✅ FIXED: Using .value property to access primitive value
const instructor = this.instructors.find(x => x.id === registration.instructorId.value);
const student = this.students.find(x => x.id === registration.studentId.value);
```

## Files Modified

### `/src/web/js/viewModel.js`
Fixed 5 locations where value object IDs were being compared incorrectly:

1. **Line 60**: Student association during registration loading
2. **Line 172**: Filtering registrations by student ID
3. **Line 180**: Filtering instructors by registration
4. **Lines 233-234**: Instructor/student lookup in admin registration table (main error source)
5. **Lines 325-326**: Instructor/student lookup in weekly schedule table

## Tests Added

### `/tests/unit/viewModel.test.js`
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Registration and Student/Instructor ID matching
- ✅ Student association in registration mapping
- ✅ Filtering logic validation
- ✅ Value object properties and behavior
- ✅ Table row generation logic
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Demonstration of the exact bug and fix

### `/tests/unit/valueObjects.test.js`
Value object specific tests covering:
- ✅ StudentId and InstructorId creation and validation
- ✅ Value object immutability
- ✅ Comparison methods (equals, toString)
- ✅ Cross-type comparisons
- ✅ Practical usage scenarios (find, filter, some operations)

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 113 passed, 0 failed
- **New Test Files**: 2 added
- **Code Coverage**: All critical ID comparison logic covered

## Impact
- ✅ Fixed registration lookup errors
- ✅ Prevented future similar bugs with comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Documented the correct way to use value objects in comparisons
- ✅ Improved code reliability and maintainability

## Prevention
The added tests will catch any regression where developers accidentally use value objects directly in comparisons instead of accessing the `.value` property.

## Key Learnings
1. Value objects require `.value` property access for primitive comparisons
2. Direct comparison of objects with primitives always returns `false`
3. Comprehensive testing prevents similar issues across the codebase
4. Error messages should be descriptive enough to trace back to the root cause
